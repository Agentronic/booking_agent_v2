## Session Summary: AG2 Agent Implementation

Today we implemented a three-agent booking system using AutoGen (AG2) framework with the following components:

### 1. Architecture Analysis
- Discussed the three-agent architecture (User Proxy, Booking Agent, Service Provider)
- Confirmed this design aligns with AutoGen patterns
- Evaluated whether to keep separate agents or consolidate

### 2. Implementation
- Created `app/agent.py` with the three-agent framework:
  - User Proxy Agent: Represents the human user
  - Booking Agent: Coordinates booking process
  - Service Provider Agent: Provides service info and availability
- Implemented GroupChat and GroupChatManager for agent communication
- Added message routing and extraction logic

### 3. Integration with App
- Modified `app.py` to conditionally use either AG2 or basic conversation handler from `app/agent.py`
- Added environment variable support via dotenv
- Created `.env.example` template
- Added fallback to basic conversation handler

### 4. Debugging & Testing
- Fixed Docker-related issues in AutoGen
- Added OpenAI dependency
- Implemented detailed logging
- Added error handling throughout the system

### 5. Conversation Management
- Implemented conversation history to maintain context between messages
- Added context retrieval and injection
- Used user IDs to track separate conversations

### 6. Configuration
- Added dotenv for configuration management
- Added environment variables for OpenAI API key and Docker settings
- Made Docker usage optional

## Session Summary: Project Restructuring and Organization

### 1. Directory Structure Reorganization
- Created a more organized project structure with dedicated directories:
  - `app/`: Application source code (agent.py, simple_agent.py, slot_calendar.py, slot_calendar_tools.py)
  - `bin/`: Executable scripts (run_app.py, cli_app.py, run_debug.py, unit-test.py)
  - `test/`: Test files
- Removed redundant files (simple_cli.py)

### 2. Import Path Updates
- Updated all import statements to reference the new module locations
- Fixed import conflicts between the app package and app.py module
- Used dynamic imports where necessary to resolve naming conflicts

### 3. Testing and Verification
- Created a comprehensive unit test runner (unit-test.py)
- Verified that all tests pass with the new structure
- Ensured that both CLI and web interfaces continue to work correctly

### 4. Documentation Updates
- Updated README.md with the new project structure and run commands
- Updated all documentation files to reference the correct file paths
- Added more detailed instructions for running tests

The implementation successfully demonstrates Phase 2 of the project plan, with a working AG2 multi-agent system for booking appointments.

## Session Summary: AG2 Agent Implementation

Today we implemented a three-agent booking system using AutoGen (AG2) framework with the following components:

### 1. Architecture Analysis
- Discussed the three-agent architecture (User Proxy, Booking Agent, Service Provider)
- Confirmed this design aligns with AutoGen patterns
- Evaluated whether to keep separate agents or consolidate

### 2. Implementation
- Created `agent.py` with the three-agent framework:
  - User Proxy Agent: Represents the human user
  - Booking Agent: Coordinates booking process
  - Service Provider Agent: Provides service info and availability
- Implemented GroupChat and GroupChatManager for agent communication
- Added message routing and extraction logic

### 3. Integration with App
- Modified `app.py` to conditionally use either AG2 or basic conversation
- Added environment variable support via dotenv
- Created `.env.example` template
- Added fallback to basic conversation handler

### 4. Debugging & Testing
- Fixed Docker-related issues in AutoGen
- Added OpenAI dependency
- Implemented detailed logging
- Added error handling throughout the system

### 5. Conversation Management
- Implemented conversation history to maintain context between messages
- Added context retrieval and injection
- Used user IDs to track separate conversations

### 6. Configuration
- Added dotenv for configuration management
- Added environment variables for OpenAI API key and Docker settings
- Made Docker usage optional

The implementation successfully demonstrates Phase 2 of the project plan, with a working AG2 multi-agent system for booking appointments.
